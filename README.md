# Fruitbowl
Show off your fruit!

Fruitbowl is meant to encourage enthusiasm and fight the taboo around being publicly bad at stuff, because beomg bad at stuff is the first step to being kinda good at stuff.

Hopefully, Fruitbowl will provide creators with the coherent narrative provided by Patreon and DeviantArt, but with the simplicity and constant engagement of Facebook and Instagram, along with some new innovations unique to Fruitbowl.

## Features
None of these are ready yet, but details will be posted as the project develops. Listed in the order they will be implemented.

### User profiles
Advertise areas of interest, links to external sites, and basic information.

### Groups
Find inspiration and like-minded creators.

### Posts
Update the status of Projects or anything else, like your mood.

### Projects
Curate Posts into a coherent narrative. Projects contain a description, tags with relevant fields of interest, and eventually the ability to assign owners with roles.

### Milestones
Create Milestones for your Projects, with the option for friends -- or yourself! -- to "pledge" rewards for reaching different stages.

### Fields, Seeds, and Sprouts
Display Projects and ideas in any stage of completion. Sometimes it helps just to put ideas somewhere, for your own use or others'. Can be public or private.

### Trees, Fruit, and Orchards
Show off mature ideas and the Fruit of your efforts, even across different interests (orchards)! Still working on the farm metaphor.

## Technical
Various backends are being considered.
